_Repository for supporting code for FIA 2023-2024 Class at ICAI iMAT_

Hi, 

Here you should find all code and versionable materials in support of our class of _Fundamentos de la Inteligencia Artificial_ (Foundations of Artificial Intelligence), at ICAI IMAT, 2023-2024 course.

This should be a read-only repository for students. Feel free to clone the repository to your local computer and work with the material here provided. If you know how to use git you can clone the repository via git commands. Otherwise, follow the [instructions here](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/) to download the repository as a ZIP file.

If you would like to make an additional contribution to the available material and share your work, let us know and we will be happy to help you do it and make it available for everyone else to see.

Saludos

Juan C. Agui, Simón Rodríguez and Andrés Occhipinti
