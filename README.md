Repository for supporting code  for FIA 23-24 Class at ICAI iMAT

Hi, 

Here you should find all code and versionable materials in support of our class for Fundamentos de Inteligencia Artificial, at ICAI IMAT, 23-24

This should be a read-only repository for students. If any of you wants to make an addition and share your work, we, the professors, will be happy to help you do it.
