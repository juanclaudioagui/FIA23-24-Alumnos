Repository for supporting code for FIA 23-24 Class at ICAI iMAT

Hi, 

Here you should find all code and versionable materials in support of our class for Fundamentos de Inteligencia Artificial, at ICAI IMAT, 23-24.

This should be a read-only repository for students. Feel free to clone the repository to your local computer. If you know how to use git and have it installed on your computer, you can use git commands to clone the repository. Otherwise, follow the instructions here to download the repository as a ZIP file:

If any of you wants to make an addition and share your work, we, the professors, will be happy to help you do it.
